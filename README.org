#+title: Nix Config

* Configuration Details

The Nix configurations are all managed in this directory. The idea is to ensure I have all the ~$HOME~ setup defined declaratively, while allowing some imperacitve adjustments when and if necessary. Also, it is designed to work with various machines and environments, so that most of the configurations can be shared among the different environments, but still there would be some additional configuratinos made possible. (Or simply duplicating some resources.)
