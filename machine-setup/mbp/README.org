#+title: Nix with MacBook Pro

This details how I configure my MBP with Nix.

* Quick Setup
Firstly, install Nix.

#+begin_src sh
  sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)
#+end_src

Then, install ~nix-darwin~:

#+begin_src sh
  nix-build https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/archive/master.tar.gz -A installer
  ./result/bin/darwin-installer
#+end_src

#+end_quote

* Non-Nix Setup
While a lot can be achieved with Nix, there are still a few items that are not managed by Nix on macOS. It may be because I have not figured out how to handle them using Nix, but here are the list of items I need to update.

- Adjust keyboard preferences (I use Dvorak + QWERTY Cmd mainly, but configure a few more keyboards as well)

There are some that I know I can manage using the Nix configurations here, but not managed yet:

- Install KeyCastr
