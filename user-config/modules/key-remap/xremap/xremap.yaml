# NOTE:
# xremap works by intercepting the input event at evdev / uinput level. This
# means that it captures before the Dvorak translation happens at the software
# level. All the key bindings need to be defined based on the hardware used,
# (e.g. how you see the keys on laptop keyboard -- with potential BIOS config
# that may change the layout) and thus could be confusing how it would actually
# map.
keymap:
  # NOTE: Xremap is order sensitive. The first definition may be overridden by
  # another binding that appears later in the file.
  # For that reason, the first items on this list is the low priority items,
  # which could be overridden by other key bindings later on.
