#+title: Sway Notification Center

https://github.com/ErikReider/SwayNotificationCenter

* Notes
- Config must be in json, not jsonc
- Because class and widget setup is quite complex, I'm using SCSS
- This means I need to run sass to generate the final CSS
- The base CSS can be retrieved from the following location
  ~/nix/store/xyz...-SwayNotificationCenter-0.10.1/etc/xdg/swaync/style.css~
