#+title: Niri

https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri

* About Niri
Niri's my daily driver as of writing (July 2024), and its support for infinite scrolling support helps managing multiple contexts at once.

* Config
Niri config uses ~.kdl~ (https://kdl.dev), and a single file input. For a better config management, I'm using the Org Mode tangle here instead.

#+begin_src kdl :tangle config.kdl :noweb yes
  // All the configs are pulled in from Org Mode file. Check out README.org.
#+end_src

** Look and Feel
*** Input
https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Input
Input configures a few tihngs

#+begin_src kdl :tangle config.kdl :noweb yes
  input {
      keyboard {
          <<input-keyboard>>
      }
      touchpad {
          <<input-touchpad>>
      }
      mouse {
          <<input-mouse>>
      }
  }
#+end_src

**** Keyboard
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle no :noweb-ref input-keyboard
:END:
There are some xkb settings I can set. For more information, see ~man 7 xkeyboard-config~.

NOTE: Because a lot of input tweaks are made by Xremap these GTK flags are not used.
- ~altwin:swap_alt_win~: Swap Alt and Super keys -- this makes it similar to Apple keyboards
- ~ctrl:nocaps~: Do not use CapsLock, and make it behave as Control
I am still using the following.
- ~grp:win_space_toggle~: Super + Space can be used for language switch.

NOTE: Currently debating whether I should switch to use fcitx5 for the actual input for everything. This means I would need to configure my language choices there, and also the keyboard layout. This is a bit more cumbersome to ensure English in Dvorak but Japanese in QWERTY. For now, I don't have too much usage of writing in Japanese, so not using fcitx5 at all.

#+begin_src kdl :tangle no :noweb-ref x
        xkb {
            
        }
#+end_src

NOTE: This is what I had before.
 #+begin_src kdl
        xkb {
            layout "us,jp"
            variant "dvorak,"
            options "grp:win_space_toggle"
        }
#+end_src

Repeat rate is for how quickly the keys repeat.
Repeat delay is how long it waits befoer key press starts repeating the sequence.
#+begin_src kdl
        repeat-rate 75
        repeat-delay 195
#+end_src

Track layout of "global" allows the same keyboard layout to be used throughout the applications. This is how it is with macOS, and Windows does per application instead (which can be enabled by using "window").
#+begin_src kdl
        track-layout "global"
#+end_src

**** Touchpad
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle no :noweb-ref input-touchpad
:END:
For some touchpad configuration.

Touchpad could be turned off entirely with ~off~ keyword -- I certainly keep it around as I use the embedded keyboard and trackpad.
#+begin_src kdl :noweb-ref input-touchpad-exc
        // off
#+end_src

Enable tap to click
#+begin_src kdl
        tap
#+end_src

~dwt~ stands for "Disable When Typing", and ~dwtp~ for "Disable When Trackpointing".
As I don't have a trackpoint with my device, I just use ~dwt~.
#+begin_src kdl
        dwt
#+end_src

Natural scroll means the iPhone like scroll. This is enabled only for the trackpad, and not for mouse (which makes a lot of sense).
#+begin_src kdl
        natural-scroll
        scroll-method "two-finger"
#+end_src

Scroll speed control -- accel-profile could be "flat" or "adaptive".
#+begin_src kdl
        accel-speed 0.2
        accel-profile "adaptive"
#+end_src

I could consider disabling the trackpad entirely when a mouse is connected. There is a config for it, but I'm not using it for now.
#+begin_src kdl :noweb-ref input-touchpad-exc
        // disabled-on-external-mouse
#+end_src

**** Mouse
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle no :noweb-ref input-mouse
:END:
While mouse configuration allows a few additional adjustments, I'm not using any of that. This is just for referenece.
#+begin_src kdl :noweb-ref input-mouse-exc
        // off
        // natural-scroll
        // accel-speed 0.2
        // accel-profile "flat"
        // scroll-method "no-scroll"
#+end_src

**** Other Input Related Flags
There are a few other flags, such as ~warp-mouse-to-focus~, ~focus-follows-mouse~, but I'm not using them.

*** Output
https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Outputs
Output configures the display settings.

TODO: This assumes the use of Asus machine for the configuration. If I need to adjust based on the machine used, I will need to come up with another way to manage different display configuration per machine.

NOTE: eDP-1 and eDP-2 are duplicated. Sometimes the display is registered with eDP-1 during bootup sequence, and sometimes some error pushes it to eDP-2. I haven't got to the bottom of this behaviour, and for the time being, duplicating it for simplicity.
#+begin_src kdl :tangle config.kdl :noweb yes
  output "eDP-1" {
      <<output-embedded>>
  }
  output "eDP-2" {
      <<output-embedded>>
  }
#+end_src

**** Embedded Display
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle no :noweb-ref output-embedded
:END:

Resolution is set by "mode" keyword.
#+begin_quote
    Resolution and, optionally, refresh rate of the output.
    The format is "<width>x<height>" or "<width>x<height>@<refresh rate>".
    If the refresh rate is omitted, niri will pick the highest refresh rate
    for the resolution.
    If the mode is omitted altogether or is invalid, niri will pick one automatically.
    Run `niri msg outputs` while inside a niri instance to list all outputs and their modes.
#+end_quote

I set it to the maximum resolution.  
#+begin_src kdl
    mode "2880x1800@120.000"
#+end_src

But with the high resolution, everything gets rendered too small, and thus change the scale to make it similar to macOS.
#+begin_src kdl
    scale 1.666667
#+end_src

I don't need any transformation for the embedded screen.
#+begin_src kdl
    transform "normal"
#+end_src

When I want to extend to external monitor, I can do that to both left and right side. I'm just pushing the embedded display a bit to the right.
The position of =1920= is calculated based on the display resolution x scale (~2880 x 1.666667 = 1920~).
#+begin_src kdl
    position x=1920 y=0
#+end_src

*** Layout
https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Layout
Layout handles some additional appearance adjustments.

#+begin_src kdl :tangle config.kdl :noweb yes
  layout {
      focus-ring {
          <<layout-focus-ring>>
      }
      border {
          <<layout-border>>
      }
      struts {
          <<layout-struts>>
      }
      preset-column-widths {
          <<layout-preset-column-widths>>
      }
      <<layout-other>>
  }
#+end_src

**** Focus Ring
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle no :noweb-ref layout-focus-ring
:END:
Focus ring is the ring that appears only when the window has focus. When there are multiple monitors used, there could be multiple windows to have focus rings, with the main one having "active" focus, and other monitors having "inactive" focus.

Because focus ring doesn't apply to those windows that do not have a focus on, I'm disabling this because I want all windows to have somewhat uniform look, which is done by "border" instead.
#+begin_src kdl
        off
#+end_src

The below is a reference only options I tested with.
#+begin_src :tangle no :noweb-ref layout-focus-ring-exc
        // How many logical pixels the ring extends out from the windows.
        width 1

        // Colors can be set in a variety of ways:
        // - CSS named colors: "red"
        // - RGB hex: "#rgb", "#rgba", "#rrggbb", "#rrggbbaa"
        // - CSS-like notation: "rgb(255, 127, 0)", rgba(), hsl() and a few others.

        // Color of the ring on the active monitor.
        // active-color "#7fc8ff22"

        // Color of the ring on inactive monitors.
        // inactive-color "#000000"

        // You can also use gradients. They take precedence over solid colors.
        // Gradients are rendered the same as CSS linear-gradient(angle, from, to).
        // The angle is the same as in linear-gradient, and is optional,
        // defaulting to 180 (top-to-bottom gradient).
        // You can use any CSS linear-gradient tool on the web to set these up.
        //
        active-gradient to="#45CB85" from="#344966" angle=75

        // You can also color the gradient relative to the entire view
        // of the workspace, rather than relative to just the window itself.
        // To do that, set relative-to="workspace-view".
        //
        inactive-gradient from="#505050" to="#808080" angle=45 relative-to="workspace-view"
#+end_src

**** Border
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle no :noweb-ref layout-border
:END:
Border is shown on all windows. One with the focus will have the "active" one. I use the gradiant look, as I like its look better than boring single colour ðŸ˜†
#+begin_src kdl
          width 3

          active-gradient \
              to="#0081AF" \
              from="#F29940" \
              angle=75
              // relative-to="workspace-view"
          inactive-gradient \
              to="#808080" \
              from="#505050" \
              angle=45
              // relative-to="workspace-view"
#+end_src

**** Struts
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle no :noweb-ref layout-struts
:END:
Additional control for outer gap. I don't use it for now, but just keeping it around.
#+begin_src kdl
        // left 64
        // right 64
        // top 64
        // bottom 64
#+end_src

**** Preset Column Widths
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle no :noweb-ref layout-preset-column-widths
:END:
For a quick resize of windows, I have some preset column widths that I can use. The values are cycled thorugh.

The values can be a proportional value (with ~proportion~), or fixed logical pixels (with ~fixed~).
#+begin_src kdl
        proportion 0.33333
        proportion 0.5
        proportion 0.75
        proportion 0.95
#+end_src

**** Other Layout Related Flags
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle no :noweb-ref layout-other
:END:

Add gap between each window.
#+begin_src kdl
      gaps 16
#+end_src

When I use ~focus-~ commands, this flag makes the window to be in the centre. When I do a three finger swipe, that won't be the case (which is how I like).
#+begin_src kdl
      center-focused-column "on-overflow"
#+end_src

I set the default window (or more precisely, column, in Niri term) to be figured out by the application. I could set some proportional or fixed value similar to the preset column width.
#+begin_src kdl
      default-column-width {}
#+end_src

*** Animations
https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Animations
Some animation related adjustment. I could adjust from the default, but the default looks nice already, and not changing at all.
#+begin_src kdl :tangle config.kdl :noweb yes
  animations {
      // Slow down all animations by this factor.
      // Values below 1 speed them up instead.
      // slowdown 3.0
  }
#+end_src

*** Misc Flags
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle config.kdl :noweb yes
:END:
There are some flags that do not fall under any categories, but play a significant role.

Unless a client application specifically asks for CSD (Client-Side Decoration), use none so that the look would fit the tiling manager look.
#+begin_src kdl
    prefer-no-csd
#+end_src

Save the screenshot in pictures directory.
#+begin_src kdl
    screenshot-path "~/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot from %Y-%m-%d %H-%M-%S.png"
#+end_src

Define a cursor look.
#+begin_src kdl
  cursor {
      xcursor-theme "breeze_cursors"
      xcursor-size  32
      hide-when-typing
  }
#+end_src

Disable help menu.
#+begin_src kdl
  hotkey-overlay {
      skip-at-startup
  }
#+end_src

*** Window Rules
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle config.kdl :noweb yes
:END:
Each window on Niri can be configured to have a different look and feel.

This is the default setting, where each window has a slight opacity set, and corner radius (or border-radius in CSS world) set to some comfortable size.
It is important to set the ~draw-border-with-background~ flag to ~false~, otherwise the border colour affects the window colour (which may look OK, but it's too much as default).
#+begin_src kdl
  window-rule {
      opacity 0.95
      clip-to-geometry true
      geometry-corner-radius 7
      draw-border-with-background false
  }
#+end_src

Browsers should not be transparent
#+begin_src kdl
  window-rule {
      match app-id="vivaldi"
      match app-id="brave"
      match app-id="firefox"
      match app-id="chromium"
      match app-id="nyxt"
      opacity 1.0
  }
#+end_src

For Emacs, I'm setting the default column to be bigger
#+begin_src kdl
  window-rule {
      match app-id="emacs"
      default-column-width { proportion 0.9; }
  }
#+end_src

Also, for Slack, I'm making it as big.
#+begin_src kdl
  window-rule {
      match app-id="slack"
      default-column-width { proportion 0.9; }
  }
#+end_src

TODO: I should configure the key handling items to be outside of screencapture / screencast.
#+begin_src kdl :tangle no
  // Example: block out two password managers from screen capture.
  // (This example rule is commented out with a "/-" in front.)
  /-window-rule {
      match app-id=r#"^org\.keepassxc\.KeePassXC$"#
      match app-id=r#"^org\.gnome\.World\.Secrets$"#
  
      block-out-from "screen-capture"
  
      // Use this instead if you want them visible on third-party screenshot tools.
      // block-out-from "screencast"
  }
#+end_src


** Programs
*** Startup Processes
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle config.kdl :noweb yes
:END:
While it is better to control the startup processes using systemd and other solutions, there are some specific ones I would only need when using Niri (or some specific Window Manager).
It is also far easier to configure here than setting up systemd, so I sometimes abuse this for a quick setup ðŸ˜›

For wallpaper setup using ~swww~, I need the daemon to be running.
#+begin_src kdl
  spawn-at-startup "swww-daemon"
#+end_src

For notification setup, I use AGS widget for now.
#+begin_src kdl
  spawn-at-startup "sh" "-c" "ags -c ~/.config/ags-notification/config.js -b notification"
#+end_src

The clipboard handling needed a bit more sophisticated control, and I moved to use ~clipse~ instead.
#+begin_src kdl :noweb-ref old
  spawn-at-startup "sh" "-c" "clipse -listen"
#+end_src

For clipboard history, I used to use ~cliphist~ mapped with ~wl-paste~.
#+begin_src kdl :noweb-ref old
  spawn-at-startup "sh" "-c" "wl-paste --watch cliphist store"
#+end_src

This is purely for a quick-and-dirty solution, but I'm using Maestral deamon startup using this startup setup. I should really have systemd configured, so that regardless of which environment I'm on, I get Maestral running.
#+begin_src kdl
  spawn-at-startup "maestral" "start" // Hack
#+end_src

*** Environment Variables
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle config.kdl :noweb yes
:END:
Some environment variables should be set for applications to startup cleanly. Namely some apps that require a few adjustments around Wayland.
#+begin_src kdl
  environment {
      <<env-var>>
  }
#+end_src

**** Wayland
Some apps do not launch with Wayland (and when there is no XWayland to fall back to). Because Niri doesn't provide XWayland at all, I need to ensure apps open up using Wayland.
#+begin_src kdl :tangle no :noweb-ref env-var
  NIXOS_OZONE_WL "1"
#+end_src

**** Bemoji / Rofi
Ensure bemoji shows up without extra spacing which rofi adds by default.
#+begin_src kdl :tangle no :noweb-ref env-var
  BEMOJI_PICKER_CMD r#"rofi -dmenu -no-show-icons"#
#+end_src

**** Japanese Input
Apparently I need the following for fcitx5 to kick in.
#+begin_src kdl :tangle no :noweb-ref env-var
  XMODIFIERS r#"@im=fcitx"#
#+end_src


** Key Bindings
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle config.kdl :noweb yes
:END:
Some global key bindings for Niri interaction.

NOTE: I got a lot of configurations in Xremap, and without it, many of the bindings won't make too much sense. You can reference how I do it, but it probably won't be useful unless you have Xremap with Dvorak keyboard layout.
#+begin_src kdl
  binds {
      <<key-bindings-commands>>

      <<key-bindings-focus>>
      <<key-bindings-size>>
      <<key-bindings-move>>

      <<key-bindings-mouse-wheel>>

      <<key-bindings-other>>
  }
#+end_src

*** Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle no :noweb-ref key-bindings-commands
:END:
+I use ~fuzzel~ for my launcher.+
I moved to use Rofi (with Wayland support) so that I can show more items in one pane.
#+begin_src kdl
  Alt+Space         { spawn "rofi" "-show" "drun"; }
  Super+Shift+Space { spawn "rofi" "-show" "window"; }
#+end_src

There are times some commands stop working. I'm making sure at least I get a terminal I can run stuff from.
#+begin_src kdl
  Shift+XF86Launch1 { spawn "ghostty"; }
#+end_src

Use ~clipse~ for the clipboard history. which needs a terminal emulator.
#+begin_src kdl
  Super+Shift+F12 { spawn "ghostty" "-e" "clipse"; }
#+end_src

TODO: Remove this once I confirm the clipse provides all the control I need.
NOTE: This is the old config.
With ~cliphist~, ~fuzzel~ is used for the clipboard history. I do use ~rofi~ for the main launcher now, but for clipboard history, I do not need the column layout, and that is easier handled with a simple setup with ~fuzzel~.
#+begin_src kdl
  Super+Alt+K   { spawn "sh" "-c" \
                  "cliphist list | fuzzel -d | cliphist decode | wl-copy" \
                  ; } // Dvorak V
#+end_src

NOTE: For emoji, I could use rofi-emoji, but decided to use ~bemoji~ which keeps the history.
#+begin_src kdl
  Super+Alt+Backslash { spawn "sh" "-c" "bemoji -t -c -n" ; }
  Super+Shift+Backslash { spawn "swaync-client" "-t" "-sw" ; }
#+end_src


Lock screen.
#+begin_src kdl
  Super+Alt+N   { spawn "swaylock"; } // Dvorak L
#+end_src

Quit Niri, which prompts before exiting.
#+begin_src kdl  
  Super+Shift+M { quit; }
#+end_src
  
Close window is the most similar to Cmd+Q on macOS, but probably more intuitive.
#+begin_src kdl
  Super+Apostrophe { close-window; } // Super + Q on Dvorak
#+end_src

*** Focus
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle no :noweb-ref key-bindings-focus
