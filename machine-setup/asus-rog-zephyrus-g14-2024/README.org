#+title: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Setup

This document is about setting up my Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 machine for work.

* Setup With Windows
There are some parts that had to be done on Windows machine.

** Adjust partition
Ensure that I have enough disk space for NixOS configuration. While I don't see myself using Windows environment too much, I kept it around in some case when I want to test out with Windows. This can be done by a GUI helper, which can be launched by typing "partition" in the Windows menu.

Because Windows 11 took up 90GB, I gave around 230GB for the entire disk space out of 1TB.

** Asus Specific Settings
Asus has "Armoury Crate" application which can adjust some settings for the device.

*** "Slash Lighting"
Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (and G16) employs the LED "slash" light on the lid surface. This can be adjusted to show different lights. I want something subtle, and thus select a theme "Neoretro" and animation pattern of "Flux" with maximum interval, brightness set to 2%.
Also, I do disable the App Notification.

*** Lighting (For Keyborad Backlight)
The colour setting can be switched using shortcut on Windows, but I don't really see myself changing it ever. I just set some not too distracting setup such as "Static", and adjust the colour to something I like instead.

** BIOS
In order to get into BIOS menu, I need to start up the machine while pressing ~F2~ key. This allows me to get the BIOS menu to make some startup adjustment.

*** Disable Secure Boot
In order for NixOS to boot from a USB device, I need to remove the "Secure Boot Control".

1. Get into BIOS menu
2. Press ~F7~ to get into "Advanced Mode"
3. Navigate with arrow keys to select "Security" pane
4. Under "Secure Boot", disable "Secure Boot Control"

*** Update Boot Order
Windows partition is the first in the list by default. By updating the boot loading priority, I can make the USB disk to be used for the initial setup.

*** Save and Exit
Ensure BIOS settings are saved with ~F10~.

* NixOS Prep
In order to get NixOS installed, I need a bootable device with NixOS installed.

** On Another Machine
If I can get another machine to configure, this should be just a matter of getting the NixOS image downloaded, and use ~dd~ or something similar

** On Windows
If I cannot get any other device to work (and this was the case for me), download Rufus https://rufus.ie/en/ to create a bootable device. In my case, I made a USB device with NixOS GNOME image first.

* Installation
Once the boot configuration is set up to use a device NixOS image, I can simply load up NixOS from the device, and then head into NixOS installation app. 

** WiFi
Before going into the NixOS config, I had a best chance of success by setting up WiFi just before that.

** Install System
NixOS installer is called Installation System in the dock.

I need to set language setup, desktop choice, unfree software, etc. Most of them can stay with the default.

* Initial Set Up
While a lot of configurations are in this repository, I need to get some tools for the initial setup.

** WiFi
I need to get the network configuration first. This needs to be done manually.

** Dark Mode
While I will be able to adjust later, this makes it easier on my eyes ðŸ«£

** WIP From Terminal
- install git ~nix-shell -p git~
- clone this repo
- ensure ssh tokens are set up so that I can pull private repos from GitHub
- ~ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "me@me.com" -f $HOME/.ssh/github_id_ed25519~
- Update ~$HOME/.ssh/config~ to include the created SSH key
- Register the key to GitHub
- Ensure the keys are copied to the root user (beacues sudo is needed)
- start rebuild ~sudo nixos-rebuild switch~
