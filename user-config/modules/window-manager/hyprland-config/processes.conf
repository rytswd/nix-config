# Hyprland allows exec and exec-once syntax to start any background tasks.
# In order to get some basic utilities to start up, I can make use of this
# configuration.

# NOTE: I should probably revisit this and use more systematic approach for
# those tools that I need in any environment, not just on Hyprland.
